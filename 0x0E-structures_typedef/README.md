Question #0
You should write documentation for all the structures you create

 True
 Iâ€™ll do it 5 minutes before the deadline when I try Betty on my header file
 As soon as I write my structure.
Question #1
The general syntax for a struct declaration in C is:

struct tag_name {
   type member1;
   type member2;
   /* declare as many members as desired, but the entire structure size must be known to the compiler. */
};
 True
 False
 Maybe
Question #2
Those two codes do the same thing:

typedef struct point point;
struct point {
   int    x;
   int    y;
};
point p = {1, 2};
typedef struct point point;
struct point {
   int    x;
   int    y;
};
point p = { .y = 2, .x = 1 };
 True
 False: the second does not compile
 False: the members of the structures will not have the same values
Question #3
Given this code:

struct point {
   int x;
   int y;
};
struct point my_point = { 3, 7 };
struct point *p = &my_point;
To set the member y of my variable my_point to 98, I can do (select all valid answers):

 my_point.y = 98;
 my_point->y = 98;
 p.y = 98;
 (*p).y = 98;
 p->y = 98;
